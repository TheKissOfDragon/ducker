# Ducker

A terminal app for managing docker containers, inpired by [K9s](https://k9scli.io/)

This is a work in progress; main aim is to get more to grips with rust.

## Build/Run

This is built with cargo (`cargo build`)

There is a convenience install script - `./install.sh`.  This script requires rust & cargo.  It will build for the local system & place in /usr/local/bin.

Note - this script will need sudo access
